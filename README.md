## What's Cool About It?

- Split view? Nope, try three-panel view for comparing text files! 📄
- We're buddies with Python 3.10 and above 🐍
- We play well with Linux, MacOS, and Windows (especially the shiny new Windows Terminal)
- Ever heard of CouchDB? We can peek into its revisions 🛋️
- Shuffling between revisions? Use the `]` `[` and `}` `{` keys
- Keep content in sync across panels 🔄
- Go full-screen or pick your favorite diff view mode, your choice!

## Getting Started

Get it via pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user DiffLume
```

To kick things off, just pop this in your terminal:

```bash
difflume
# or
python3 -m difflume
```

More of a Docker person? We got you:

```bash
docker run -it --rm yakim/difflume
```
